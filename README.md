Predicting the outcome of soccer matches in the English Premier League.
This is a project for the course 'Algorithms for Data Guided Business Intelligence'. 

**Linear and Support Vector Regression**

The Linear Regression folder consists of data_processor.py and test_data_preprocessing.py that contains code to preprocess the training and testing data to extract the features required to train the model .  data_processor.py generates the file aggregated_features.csv in the R_Data_load folder. test_data_preprocessing.py generates the test_features.csv in the test folder.

The code for running the model is contained in regression.R that consists of training the models using linear regression and support vector regression respectively .
After running the R code we get the accuracy for the particular model as an output to the console.
